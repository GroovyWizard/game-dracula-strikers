# Dracula Strikers
Dracula Strikers is a Open Source game made in Unity (C#) just for fun and educational purposes! The goal is to create an infinite sidescroller with rpg elements.

**WARNING** 
Currently Dracula Strikers uses sprites from the game **Castlevania: Symphony of The Night** but this will change soon.
